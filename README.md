This is my attempted solution to the computational problems from Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity by James Sethna. The book explores some intriguing applications of statistical mechanics, both within and beyond the realm of physics. In this markdown, I first provide a brief summary of the key concepts of statistical mechanics, followed by an introduction to each computational problem I have worked through.



## Key Concepts in Statistical Mechanics

*Ensemble*
How do we connect microscopic laws with macroscopic phenomena? The concept of an ensemble provides a method for this connection. It treats a large system (macroscopic) as a collection of similarly prepared systems (microscopic), allowing us to study the system statistically.

*Entropy*
Entropy, when defined as a function of the probability distribution \\(p_{i}\\), must satisfy the following conditions:

Maximum at \\(p_{i} = \frac{1}{N}\\)
Minimum at \\(p_{i} = 0\\) with \\(S = 0\\)
Minimum at \\(p_{i} = 1\\) with \\(S = 0\\)
The unique function that meets these conditions is \\(S = -\sum p_{i} \log{p_{i}}\\), which leads to the information interpretation of entropy. From the first condition, we see that entropy is maximized when the distribution is more even, or more "mixed," aligning with the disorder interpretation of entropy. When entropy is zero, the probability distribution is either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), meaning that we can reproduce the system with certainty. As entropy increases, reproducing the system becomes less likely, giving rise to the concept of irreversibility.

*Quantum Statistical Mechanics*
Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic evolution of systems and determines particle types. In everyday life, where temperatures are sufficiently high, quantum mechanical effects can be ignored because quantum states are thermalized, leading to equal occupation of states. At high temperatures, particles behave like ideal gases with no internal structure.

However, as the temperature drops, states may settle into asymmetric configurations, leading to unusual behavior.

*Monte Carlo*
Monte Carlo methods allow computers to find ensemble averages in systems that are too complex for analytical solutions. These methods are essential in statistical mechanics for handling large, complicated systems.

*Phases*
Different phases of matter are characterized by different symmetries. Phases with different symmetries cannot be connected via perturbation theory. So far, two primary types of phase transitions are recognized: abrupt phase transitions and continuous phase transitions.

*Fluctuations and Correlations*
The response of a system is closely related to its correlation function, which measures the alignment of states within the system. This function condenses key information about the systemâ€™s internal structure and behavior.

*Abrupt Phase Transition*
As the name suggests, abrupt phase transitions occur when there is a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy. The phase boundary must have equal free energy, but above and below this boundary, the free energy functions differ.

*Criticality*
The second type of phase change is a continuous phase transition. This occurs when the symmetry of the matter changes. At the critical temperature where the transition takes place, fluctuations in the system become singular at zero frequency modes, and the system exhibits self-similarity. This phenomenon is universal across different physical systems.
