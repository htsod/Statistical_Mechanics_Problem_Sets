## Digital Material

This folder contains multiple exercises that are solved by computer simulation. The older verison of Digital Material has a few incompatibility to the current scientific computation package in python. Particularlly, modification has been made to update the visualization pacakge vpython and matplotlib, as well as the computation package scipy to numpy. 

Simulation is a modern method using a computer to mimic a physical system such that properties of the system can be calculated without going through the experiment. However, it is not possible to actually simulate every details of the system. All we are doing is that we expect the system will behave the same in this simulation time scale, spatial scale and particle scale. It is like doing a perturbation calculation. The correctness of the simulation only restricted in this regime of approximation.

It is still useful in the sense that it double checks our understanding by straightforward visual.


### Solving the Problem


In this exercise, the following physical system is being tested:


1. The process of Equilibration.



2. Pair Distribution Calculation Scheme



3. Statistical properties of Random Walk




4. Statistical Measure of Pressure



### Possible Extension to the Problems
