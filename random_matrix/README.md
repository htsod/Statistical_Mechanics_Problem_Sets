# Random Matrix

Random matrix study the distribution of eigenvalues of gaussian generated matrices. 

Some quotes from the problem:

> In many cases, the statistical behavior of systems exhibiting complex phenomena, almost any crrelations involving eigenvalues and eigenstates, can be quantitatively modeled using ensembles of matrices with completely random, uncorrelated entries.

> Many different ensembles of symmetric matrices, as the size N goes to infinity, have eigenvalue and eigenvector distributions tht are invariant under orthogonal transformation even though the original matrix ensemble did not have this symmetry. Similarly, rotational symmetry emerges in random walks on the square lattice as the number of steps N goes to infinity, and also emerges on long length scales for Ising momdels at their critical temperatures.

I believe this also explains the phenomenon of broken symmetries. In systems with low dimensionality, whether it's low temperature in the Ising model or the time steps in random walks, the available states are not uniformly or fully occupied, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of states. As \\(N\\) increases, more states are distributed across these gaps, gradually filling the asymmetrical spaces.
