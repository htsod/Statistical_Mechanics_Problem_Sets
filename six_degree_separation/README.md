# six_degree_separation

six degree separation is a rough estimation of the network connectivity of a random network.

> A random network is constrcuted probabilistically according to some definite rules; studying such random network usually is done by studying the entire ensemble of networks, each weighted by the probability that it was constructed.

- rules: construct a random network that has L nodes, Z connected neighbors and probability of $ L \times Z/2 \times p $ shortcuts added to the network

### Path length distribution

For a critical values of random edges added, the graph becomes much more connected, essentially goes through phase transition to a more connected states.
